          VNI allocated by the global manager

          The global VNI pool is agnostic of the local VNI pool, and there is
          no need to have an exclusive VNI range. For example, VNI x can be
          the global VNI for logical switch B and the local VNI for logical switch A

          Flag to identify a hybrid logical switch
          If this flag is set to true, then all the logical switch ports attached to
          this logical switch will behave in a hybrid fashion. The hybrid logical switch port
          indicates to NSX that the VM intends to operate in underlay mode,
          but retains the ability to forward egress traffic to the NSX overlay network.
          This flag can be enabled only for the logical switches in the overlay type transport zone which has
          host switch mode as STANDARD and also has either CrossCloud or CloudScope tag scopes.
          Only the NSX public cloud gateway (PCG) uses this flag, other host agents like ESX, KVM and Edge
          will ignore it. This property cannot be modified once the logical switch is created

          This field indicates purpose of a LogicalSwitch. It is set by manager internally
          or user can provide this field. If not set, DEFAULT type is assigned.
          NSX components can use this field to create LogicalSwitch that provides component
          specific functionality.
          DEFAULT type LogicalSwitches are created for basic L2 connectivity by API users.
          SERVICE_PLANE type LogicalSwitches are system created service plane LogicalSwitches for
          Service Insertion service. User can not create SERVICE_PLANE type of LogicalSwitch.
          DHCP_RELAY type LogicalSwitches are created by external user like Policy with special
          permissions or by system and will be treated as internal LogicalSwitches. Such
          LogicalSwitch will not be exposed to vSphere user.
          GLOBAL type LogicalSwitches are created to span multiple NSX domains to connect multiple
          remote sites.

          not specified, the logical switch will not have a teaming policy
